This is a TODO list for changes in both this plugin and for photivo
changes related to this plugin

Is Tools the correct menu for this plugin?

Add item to photivo.
Input=>Open sidecar file
Option to have sidecar to be removed
Maybe sidecar could be deleted as new image file is loaded.

Add menu item to services menu so that photivo can be opened from
light table image, or from main image, without using Tools menu.
