This is a TODO list for changes in both this plugin and for photivo
changes related to this plugin

Is Tools the correct menu for this plugin?

Add item to photivo menu:
Input=>Open sidecar file
There should be an Option to have sidecar to be removed
Maybe sidecar could be deleted as a new image file is loaded.

Add menu item to services menu so that photivo can be opened from
light table image, or from main image, without using Tools menu.

Batch mode includes sidecar. Ratings and tags are included, but
headline and caption does not appear.

After tiff file is created, digikam needs to reread it.
Sometimes, tiff file does not have tags written to it.
